### What is this folder for? ###

* ACM Independent Study Project

### What is this? ###

* Two files, `joinNew.py` (Gui) and `emailNew.py` (information-->MailLists) work together side by side to achieve the goal
* `email.py` and `cult.py` are necessary for `joinNew.py` and `emailNew.py` to function properly and our files are using functions from `email.py` and `cult.py`
* The image file is used to generate the logo of `joinNew.py`
* First, users should run `joinNew.py` to collect user information (internet connection not needed) 
* Then use `emailNew.py` to add the email addresses to the MailLists (internet connection needed)
