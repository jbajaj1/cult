### What is this folder for? ###

* ACM Independent Study Project
* GUI that takes in user's name, email, and shirt size so that they can be contacted later to pick up and pay for their shirts
* This folder is a good example of a GUI that can be generated using the modularized code of the ModularizedGUI folder
### What is this? ###

* Two files, `shirtsNew.py` (Gui) and `emailShirts.py` (information-->MailLists) work together side by side to achieve the goal
* `email.py` and `cult.py` are necessary for `joinNew.py` and `emailNew.py` to function properly and the files are using functions from `email.py` and `cult.py`
* The image file is used to generate the logo of `joinNew.py`
* First, users should run `shirtsNew.py` to collect user information (internet connection not needed) 
* Then use `emailShirts.py` to email the users about their purchases (internet connection needed)
