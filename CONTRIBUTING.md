### How to contribute ###
We are happy to have any ACM members clone this repo add to the work that has already been done.
We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes that get things working in your environment. 
There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.

### Modules ###
We prefer new functionality to be typically directed toward modules to reduce the size of the repo and maximize code reuse.

### Getting Started ###
* Make sure you have an ACM account
* Log in to GitLab via Kerberos
* This git repo visability is set to internal, meaning any ACM member the logs in to Gitlab can find this repo.
* Fork the repository

### Making Changes ###
* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
* This is usually the master branch.
* Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that branch.
* To quickly create a topic branch based on master; `git checkout -b fix/master/my_contribution master`. Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format. 
* Please make sure you have not broken anything within the code.

### Submitting Changes ###
* Make sure you fork the repo.
* Make sure you understand the License -> see `LICENSE` for the MIT License Documentation.
* Push your changes to a branch in your forked repo.
* Submit a merge/pull request to the main repo.
